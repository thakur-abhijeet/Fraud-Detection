## Using the Fraud Detection System

### Basic Usage

The fraud detection system can be used to analyze transactions, login attempts, and refund requests. Here's a basic example of how to analyze a transaction:

```python
from src.unified_risk_scoring import UnifiedRiskScoringSystem

# Initialize the system
risk_system = UnifiedRiskScoringSystem()

# Load pre-trained models (if available)
risk_system.load_models()

# Analyze a transaction
transaction_data = {
    'transaction_id': 'T123456',
    'user_id': 'U12345',
    'timestamp': '2025-04-01T14:30:00',
    'amount': 299.99,
    'payment_method': 'credit_card',
    'product_category': 'electronics',
    'ip_address': '192.168.1.1',
    'device_id': 'D12345'
}

user_data = {
    'user_id': 'U12345',
    'account_age_days': 120,
    'previous_purchases': 5
}

session_data = {
    'session_id': 'S12345',
    'ip_address': '192.168.1.1',
    'user_agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
}

# Analyze the transaction
results = risk_system.analyze_transaction(transaction_data, user_data, session_data)

# Print the results
print(f"Overall Risk Score: {results['overall_risk_score']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {results['risk_level']}")
print(f"Recommended Action: {results['recommended_action']}")
```

### Analyzing Login Attempts

To analyze a login attempt for potential account takeover:

```python
# Analyze a login attempt
login_data = {
    'user_id': 'U12345',
    'timestamp': '2025-04-01T14:30:00',
    'ip_address': '192.168.1.1',
    'device_id': 'D12345',
    'user_agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
}

# Analyze the login attempt
login_results = risk_system.analyze_login_attempt(login_data, user_data, session_data)

# Print the results
print(f"Login Risk Score: {login_results['overall_risk_score']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {login_results['risk_level']}")
print(f"Recommended Action: {login_results['recommended_action']}")
```

### Analyzing Refund Requests

To analyze a refund request for potential refund fraud:

```python
# Analyze a refund request
refund_data = {
    'refund_id': 'R12345',
    'transaction_id': 'T123456',
    'user_id': 'U12345',
    'timestamp': '2025-04-05T10:15:00',
    'amount': 299.99,
    'reason': 'product_not_as_described'
}

order_data = {
    'transaction_id': 'T123456',
    'user_id': 'U12345',
    'timestamp': '2025-04-01T14:30:00',
    'amount': 299.99,
    'delivery_status': 'delivered',
    'delivery_date': '2025-04-03T12:00:00'
}

# Analyze the refund request
refund_results = risk_system.analyze_refund_request(refund_data, order_data, user_data)

# Print the results
print(f"Refund Risk Score: {refund_results['overall_risk_score']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {refund_results['risk_level']}")
print(f"Recommended Action: {refund_results['recommended_action']}")
```

### Customizing the System

### Adjusting Risk Weights

You can customize the weights assigned to different fraud types in the unified risk score:

```python
# Adjust risk weights
risk_system.set_risk_weights({
    'credit_card_fraud': 0.4,    # Increase weight for credit card fraud
    'account_takeover': 0.3,
    'friendly_fraud': 0.15,
    'promotion_abuse': 0.05,
    'refund_fraud': 0.05,
    'bot_activity': 0.05
})
```

### Adjusting Risk Thresholds

You can also customize the thresholds for risk level classification:

```python
# Adjust risk thresholds
risk_system.set_risk_thresholds({
    'high_risk': 0.8,     # More strict threshold for high risk
    'medium_risk': 0.5,   # More strict threshold for medium risk
    'low_risk': 0.3       # More strict threshold for low risk
})
```

### Training Custom Models

If you have labeled fraud data, you can train custom models for better performance:

```python
from src.credit_card_fraud_detection import CreditCardFraudDetector

# Initialize the detector
cc_detector = CreditCardFraudDetector()

# Load your transaction data
import pandas as pd
transactions = pd.read_csv('your_transaction_data.csv')
labels = pd.read_csv('your_fraud_labels.csv')

# Train a custom model
cc_detector.train_ml_model(transactions, labels)

# Save the model
cc_detector.save_model('your_custom_model.pkl')
```

## Interpreting Results

### Risk Scores

The system assigns risk scores on a scale from 0 to 1:

- **0.0 - 0.2**: Very low risk
- **0.2 - 0.4**: Low risk
- **0.4 - 0.7**: Medium risk
- **0.7 - 1.0**: High risk

### Recommended Actions

Based on the risk level, the system recommends one of the following actions:

- **allow**: Allow the transaction/action to proceed
- **monitor**: Allow but monitor for suspicious activity
- **additional_verification**: Require additional verification (e.g., 3D Secure, email confirmation)
- **block_transaction**: Block the transaction
- **manual_review**: Flag for manual review
- **block_and_notify**: Block the action and notify the user

### Risk Reports

You can generate risk reports to analyze fraud patterns:

```python
# Generate a risk report for the last 30 days
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

report = risk_system.generate_risk_report(start_date, end_date)

# Print report summary
print(f"Total Transactions: {report['total_transactions']}")
print(f"High Risk Transactions: {report['risk_levels']['counts']['high']} ({report['risk_levels']['percentages']['high']:.2f}%)")
print(f"Medium Risk Transactions: {report['risk_levels']['counts']['medium']} ({report['risk_levels']['percentages']['medium']:.2f}%)")
```

### Visualizations

The system provides visualization tools to help you understand fraud patterns:

```python
# Plot risk distribution
risk_system.plot_risk_distribution(save_path='risk_distribution.png')

# Plot fraud types
risk_system.plot_fraud_types(save_path='fraud_types.png')
```

## Integration with E-commerce Platforms

### API Integration

The fraud detection system can be integrated with your e-commerce platform through a REST API. Here's a basic example of how to set up an API endpoint using Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from src.unified_risk_scoring import UnifiedRiskScoringSystem

app = Flask(__name__)
risk_system = UnifiedRiskScoringSystem()
risk_system.load_models()

@app.route('/api/analyze_transaction', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_transaction():
    data = request.json
    
    transaction_data = data.get('transaction_data', {})
    user_data = data.get('user_data', {})
    session_data = data.get('session_data', {})
    
    results = risk_system.analyze_transaction(transaction_data, user_data, session_data)
    
    return jsonify(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### Database Integration

For direct database integration, you can modify the data loading functions in the system to connect to your database:

```python
def get_user_transactions(self, user_id):
    """
    Get a user's transaction history from the database.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    user_id : str
        User identifier
        
    Returns:
    --------
    pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with user's transaction history
    """
    import sqlite3
    
    # Connect to your database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
    
    # Query user transactions
    query = f"SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'"
    user_transactions = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    
    return user_transactions
```

## Best Practices
