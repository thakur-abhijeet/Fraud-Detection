## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the E-commerce Fraud Detection System. The system is designed to detect and prevent various types of fraud in e-commerce platforms, including credit card fraud, account takeovers, friendly fraud (chargeback fraud), promotion abuse, refund fraud, bot attacks, and synthetic identity fraud.

The fraud detection system employs a multi-layered approach, combining rule-based checks, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and behavioral analytics to identify potentially fraudulent activities. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration with existing e-commerce platforms and customization based on specific business needs.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this fraud detection system is to:

1. Identify and prevent fraudulent transactions before they are processed
2. Detect account takeover attempts to protect user accounts
3. Identify potential friendly fraud (chargeback fraud) to reduce chargeback rates
4. Detect promotion/coupon abuse to prevent revenue loss
5. Identify refund fraud patterns to reduce fraudulent refund requests
6. Detect bot attacks and automated activities
7. Identify synthetic identities to prevent account creation fraud

The system is designed for e-commerce platforms of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises, and can be customized based on specific business requirements and risk tolerance levels.

## System Architecture

The fraud detection system follows a modular architecture, with each module focusing on a specific type of fraud. The modules work together through a unified risk scoring system that combines the risk assessments from individual modules to provide a comprehensive fraud risk evaluation.

## Mathematical Concepts and Algorithms

This section provides detailed explanations of the key mathematical concepts and algorithms used in the fraud detection system.

### Statistical Methods

#### Z-Score Analysis
Z-score analysis is used to identify anomalous transaction amounts by comparing a transaction amount to the user's historical transaction amounts.

**Formula:**
```
Z = (X - μ) / σ
```
Where:
- Z is the z-score
- X is the transaction amount
- μ is the mean of the user's historical transaction amounts
- σ is the standard deviation of the user's historical transaction amounts

A high absolute z-score (typically |Z| > 2 or |Z| > 3) indicates an unusual transaction amount that may be fraudulent.

#### Velocity Checks
Velocity checks analyze the frequency and volume of transactions within specific time windows to identify unusual patterns.

**Key metrics:**
- Number of transactions in a time window
- Total amount spent in a time window
- Number of different countries/locations in a time window

Transactions that exceed predefined thresholds for these metrics are flagged as potentially fraudulent.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

**Key advantages for fraud detection:**
- Handles high-dimensional data well
- Robust to outliers and noise
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Handles both numerical and categorical features
- Less prone to overfitting than individual decision trees

In the fraud detection system, Random Forest is used for:
- Credit card fraud classification
- Account takeover detection
- Chargeback prediction
- Bot detection
- Synthetic identity detection

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

**Formula:**
```
P(Y=1) = 1 / (1 + e^-(β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ))
```
Where:
- P(Y=1) is the probability of the positive class (fraud)
- X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are the feature values
- β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ are the model coefficients

In the fraud detection system, Logistic Regression is used as an alternative to Random Forest for:
- Credit card fraud classification
- Chargeback prediction

#### Isolation Forest
Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm that explicitly identifies anomalies by isolating observations.

**Key concept:**
Anomalies are "few and different," which makes them more susceptible to isolation in a tree structure. The algorithm builds an ensemble of isolation trees, and anomalies will have shorter average path lengths in these trees.

In the fraud detection system, Isolation Forest is used for:
- Anomaly detection in transaction amounts
- Identification of unusual transaction patterns

#### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together, marking points in low-density regions as outliers.

**Key parameters:**
- ε (eps): The maximum distance between two points for them to be considered neighbors
- MinPts: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region

In the fraud detection system, DBSCAN is used for:
- Location anomaly detection in account takeover prevention

### Distance Calculations

#### Haversine Formula
The Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.

**Formula:**
```
a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ₁) × cos(φ₂) × sin²(Δλ/2)
c = 2 × atan2(√a, √(1-a))
d = R × c
```
Where:
- φ is latitude in radians
- λ is longitude in radians
- R is the Earth's radius (mean radius = 6,371 km)

In the fraud detection system, the Haversine formula is used for:
- Calculating distance between login locations in account takeover prevention
- Determining if a login location is anomalous

### Risk Scoring

#### Weighted Average
The unified risk scoring system uses a weighted average to combine risk scores from different fraud detection modules.

**Formula:**
```
Overall Risk Score = (w₁ × s₁ + w₂ × s₂ + ... + wₙ × sₙ) / (w₁ + w₂ + ... + wₙ)
```
Where:
- s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ are the risk scores from different fraud detection modules
- w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ are the weights assigned to each module

The weights can be adjusted based on the specific needs and risk tolerance of the e-commerce platform.

## Performance Evaluation

This section describes the methods and metrics used to evaluate the performance of the fraud detection system.

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Classification Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases examined.
   ```
   Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
   ```

2. **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
   ```
   Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
   ```

3. **Recall (Detection Rate)**: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.
   ```
   Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
   ```

4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   ```
   F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   ```

5. **AUC-ROC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.

#### Fraud-Specific Metrics

1. **Fraud Detection Rate**: The percentage of fraudulent transactions that are correctly identified.
   ```
   Fraud Detection Rate = TP / (TP + FN)
   ```

2. **False Positive Rate**: The percentage of legitimate transactions that are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent.
   ```
   False Positive Rate = FP / (FP + TN)
   ```

3. **Chargeback Rate**: The percentage of transactions that result in chargebacks.
   ```
   Chargeback Rate = Number of Chargebacks / Number of Transactions
   ```

4. **Manual Review Rate**: The percentage of transactions that require manual review.
   ```
   Manual Review Rate = Number of Reviews / Number of Transactions
   ```

### Cross-Validation

The system uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. This involves splitting the data into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and validating on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset used exactly once as the validation data.

### Model Comparison

Different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) are compared based on their performance metrics to select the best model for each fraud detection task.

### Threshold Optimization

Risk thresholds are optimized to balance the trade-off between fraud detection rate and false positive rate. This involves analyzing the ROC curve and selecting thresholds that provide the desired balance based on business requirements.

### A/B Testing

New fraud detection features and models are evaluated through A/B testing, where a subset of transactions is processed using the new approach while the rest continue to use the existing approach. The performance of both approaches is compared to determine if the new approach provides significant improvements.
